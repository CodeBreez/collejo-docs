## Batches

Batches are how Collejo keeps track of each course or grade on each enrollment of students. When a new batch of students are being enrolles a new Batch must be created along with it's Terms / Semesters and Grades / Courses. The batch start and end dates can be determined based on the actual start and end times of the batch or the school year.

For schools a minimum of batch is necessary for a year while, for univercities batches can be created per course.
