## Installation Documentation
### Installing on a Shared Host

To install on a shared host it is recommended that you follow the same steps of [installing Collejo on a VPS server](/installation-guide/vps_installation.md), on a local development environment. Use an FTP tool such as [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org) to upload everything to the server.

Update the .env file with the database credentials and you're ready to go.
