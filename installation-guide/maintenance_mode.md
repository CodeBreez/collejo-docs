### Maintenance Mode

When your application is in maintenance mode, a view will be displayed for all requests into your application. This makes it easy to "disable" your application while it is updating or when you are performing maintenance. 

To enable maintenance mode, simply execute the down Artisan command:

````php artisan down````

To disable maintenance mode, use the up command:

````php artisan up````
