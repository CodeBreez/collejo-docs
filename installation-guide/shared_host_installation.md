### Installing on a Shared Host

To install on a shared host it is recommended that you follow the same steps of [installing COllejo on a VPS server](/vps_installation.md), on a local development environment. Use an FTP tool such as [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org) to upload them to the server.
