# Collejo 
## Installation Documentation
### Installing on a VPS

Collejo utilizes [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) to manage its dependencies. So, before installing Collejo, make sure you have Composer installed on your machine.

To create a new Collejo installation use Composer `create-project` command followed by the optional installation directory name.

````composer create-project codebreez/collejo 

A new directory will be created on the root you ran the command. Composer will automatically install all the PHP packages required to run Collejo.
